An epic battle scene in a coding environment showing a developer warrior facing a giant robot made of TypeScript logos and error symbols. The robot has "admin.blog_posts" written on its chest and is shooting laser beams of red error messages. The developer holds a glowing shield with "RLS" (Row Level Security) written on it that's deflecting the errors, and wields a sword labeled "public schema". In the background, falling "admin." prefixes are dissolving into green checkmarks. Comic book art style meets tech illustration, dramatic lighting with purple and blue tones, dynamic action pose.
